# Grover's algorithm
## A simulation of Groverâ€™s algorithm

Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm used for unstructured search problems. This algorithm has a quadratic improvement compared to classical algorithms. In other words, with $N$ entries in an unsorted database, classical algorithms require a cost of $O(N)$, Grover's algorithm only requires the number of operations equal to the square root of $N$, $O(\sqrt{N})$. This is a considerable improvement when $N$ is a large number. With this improvement and the advancement of quantum computing technology, Grover's algorithm will be potentially applied in different fields, i.e., Exhaustive Key Search in Cryptography.

In this project, we will implement Grover's algorithm on an unstructured search problem. We will use Grover's algorithm to perform Exhaustive Key Search on a toy block cipher, and discuss how it is implemented and how it works through the implementation. The implementation uses [Quantum Simulator Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit). We will create quantum circuits for Encryption and Decryption process of the block cipher, and for Grover's algorithm.
